# run_all.sh — HypatiaX JMLR v3.0 full numerical reproduction pipeline
#
# FIX CRITICAL 1 : 'instability' → 'hybrid_all_domains' (CI naming alignment)
# FIX CRITICAL 2 : suppB_sc step added (sample-complexity sweep)
# FIX CRITICAL 3 : hybrid_llm_nn/all_domains (not /defi) used throughout
# FIX STEP-11-12 : tables (Step 11) + figures (Step 12) both write to
#                  ${RESULTS_DIR}/tables  and  ${RESULTS_DIR}/figures
#                  — previously tables wrote to ${REPO_ROOT}/scripts/paper/tables
# FIX STEP-11-12b: tables and figures steps now cd to REPO_ROOT and invoke
#                  scripts/generate_tables.py and scripts/generate_figures.py
#                  — previously used cd REPO_ROOT/tables and cd REPO_ROOT/figures
#                    which caused tracer errors: script NOT FOUND at those dirs.
# FIX WARN-2     : HYBRID_ALL_DOMAINS_EXPECTED corrected to 10-domain list that
#                  matches CI HYBRID_ALL_DOMAINS_IDS and ExperimentProtocolAll
# FIX STEP-ORDER : removed exp2_sym / exp2_hyb (no run-blocks exist for them)
# FIX-suppA-1    : suppA cd REPO_ROOT (not EXPERIMENTS_DIR) — fixes doubled-path
#                  ENOENT on all three Python scripts (hypatiax/core/..., etc.)
# FIX-suppA-2    : suppA mkdir -p results dirs before first tee — fixes
#                  "tee: No such file or directory" when run standalone
# FIX-suppA-3    : suppA runs all three scripts (run_hybrid_system_benchmark.py,
#                  test_enhanced_defi_extrapolation.py, analyze_hybrid_performance.py)
#                  with tee / tee -a into suppA_run.log
# FIX-exp1b-1    : exp1b cd REPO_ROOT (not EXPERIMENTS_DIR) — mirrors suppA-1/exp1 fix.
#                  hypatiax_defi_benchmark_v3c.py writes to os.getcwd()/hypatiax/data/results;
#                  calling from EXPERIMENTS_DIR doubled the path → ENOENT on all outputs.
# FIX-exp1b-2/3  : removed --noise-level 15 and --output-dir from exp1b invocation.
#                  Those flags are NOT in hypatiax_defi_benchmark_v3c.py's argparse;
#                  passing them caused "unrecognized arguments" SystemExit(2) (CI log line 426).
#                  The noise-level/output-dir concern is handled by the dest15 mv block.
# FIX-exp1b-4    : portfolio_variance_v3c2.py now guarded by a pre-flight JSON check.
#                  It reads the benchmark JSON as a prerequisite; when that file is absent
#                  df_pysr=None → AttributeError on line 375 "df_pysr.columns" (CI log line 448).
#                  Fix: skip with a warning when benchmark JSON not yet present; use || echo
#                  so a non-zero exit from the variance script doesn't abort the whole step.
# FIX-exp1b-5    : move block now searches both EXPERIMENTS_DIR and RESULTS_DIR root.
#                  After the cd REPO_ROOT fix, outputs land in RESULTS_DIR (not EXPERIMENTS_DIR),
#                  so the original single-root find missed them entirely.
# FIX-suppA-4    : suppA move block now searches REPO_ROOT, EXPERIMENTS_DIR, and RESULTS_DIR.
#                  After cd REPO_ROOT, run_hybrid_system_benchmark.py may write to RESULTS_DIR
#                  directly; searching only EXPERIMENTS_DIR missed all files.
# FIX-suppA-5    : suppA move glob aligned with CI YAML move_matching calls (lines 1455-1458).
#                  CI matches: consolidated_hybrid_*.json → hybrid_pysr/defi
#                              hybrid_llm_nn_all_domains_*.json → hybrid_llm_nn/all_domains
#                              ablation_exp1_*.json + hypatiax_defi_benchmark_v3_results* → RESULTS_DIR root
#                  run_all.sh previously matched hybrid_system*.json (wrong glob, not in CI).
# SYNC-ci (2026-05-14):
#   — git push now uses HEAD:ref_name (not hardcoded master)
#   — consolidate timeout-minutes: 30 added
#   — Upload consolidated artifact: if: always() added
#   — shard_matrix=[] emitted on empty-pending to let worker if-guard fire
#   — JOB_DEADLINE exported to exp3/exp3b subprocess env
#   — python3 -c IndentationErrors fixed (3 sites in worker step)
#
# FIX-NSHARDS1-AUDIT (2026-05-25):
#   — extrap: added --resume flag to match exp2_feynman; without it extrap re-runs
#     all 11 domains from scratch on every retry, ignoring the CI RESUME=true env var.
#     run_comparative_suite_benchmark_v2.py only honours --resume (not the env var).
#   — suppB: NOISE_LEVELS forwarded explicitly as env var to run_noise_sweep_benchmark.py
#     so custom dispatch inputs are respected; previously the script used its own default.
#   — suppB: --samples, --pysr-timeout, --method-timeout, --populations, --parsimony
#     now passed as CLI args (matching repro.yaml / CI values) rather than relying on
#     the script picking them up from the environment — eliminates the env-vs-CLI gap.
#   — suppB_sc: same repro.yaml CLI flag set added (--samples, --pysr-timeout,
#     --method-timeout, --populations, --parsimony) — mirrors suppB fix.
#   — exp1, exp2_feynman: confirmed correct for NSHARDS=1; no changes needed.

#
# FIX-MERGE-QUOTING (2026-06-07):
#   — exp2_feynman_extrap merge block: extracted from bash -c "" into a standalone
#     ( ) subshell block.  The original \\\\\\" (3-backslash+quote) and \\\\\\$
#     (3-backslash+dollar) patterns inside the double-quoted outer string produced
#     literal backslashes in paths after bash parsing (_PAIRED=\"path\") and
#     suppressed command substitution (_NR=\$(...) never ran).  Rewritten as plain
#     bash with no nesting, matching the exp2_feynman_pca_comparison_table and
#     exp3_symbolic_equivalence inlined blocks.
#   — Final summary: corrected phantom log reference qualify_verify_run.log ->
#     qualify_run.log (the qualify step only ever writes qualify_run.log).
#
# FIX-SYNC-CI (2026-06-05):
#   — exp2_feynman_pca_comparison_table logic inlined after exp2_feynman_pca_4060.
#     Calls scripts/patches/generate_exp2_pca_comparison_table.py to produce
#     exp2_pca_comparison.{tex,csv,md} — mirrors ci_analysis.yml and ci_postprocess.yml.
#     NOT a separate registered step; runs as plain shell after exp2_feynman_pca_4060.
#   — exp3_symbolic_equivalence logic inlined after exp3b.
#     Calls scripts/check_symbolic_equivalence.py against all
#     exp3_nguyen12_seed*.json files — mirrors ci_analysis.yml Check symbolic
#     equivalence step.  Output: symbolic_equivalence_report.csv + _summary.txt.
#     NOT a separate registered step; runs as plain shell after exp3b.
#   — merge_extrap_into_benchmark.py now called inside exp2_feynman_extrap step
#     (replacing the NOTE that deferred it entirely to ci_analysis.yml).
#     Produces ablation_paired.json in exp2_extrap/ so qualify and audit_paper
#     can run locally without requiring ci_analysis.yml to run first.
#     Skips gracefully when the script or benchmark_results_extrap*.json is absent.
#   — tables step now also calls generate_exp2_pca_comparison_table.py and
#     generate_nguyen12_symequiv_table.py — mirrors ci_postprocess.yml's
#     "Generate PCA comparison table" and "Generate symbolic equivalence table"
#     steps.  Both are skipped gracefully when prerequisite files are absent.
#   — _STEP_ORDER kept at 35 entries (tracer _DECLARED_ORDER); the two new
#     sub-steps are not registered so --step / --from targeting is unaffected.
#
# FIX-C3-ESCAPE (2026-06-04):
#   — exp1_pca and exp1b_pca: removed erroneous backslash-escaping on
#     REPO_ROOT, EXPERIMENTS_DIR, and RESULTS_DIR inside the outer bash -c
#     double-quoted string.  \${REPO_ROOT} was passed as a literal string to
#     the subshell (which has no such variable), causing:
#       bash: cd: ${REPO_ROOT}: No such file or directory
#       python3: can't open file '.../${EXPERIMENTS_DIR}/...': No such file or directory
#       FileNotFoundError: .../defi_pca/split_protocol_disclosure.json
#     All three outer-scope variables (REPO_ROOT, EXPERIMENTS_DIR, RESULTS_DIR)
#     now use unescaped ${VAR} so bash expands them at parse time, matching the
#     pattern used correctly in exp1, exp1b, extrap, suppA, and all other steps.
#     Inner subshell variables (_PCA_DEFI_DIR, _PCA15_DIR, _SHARD, etc.) retain
#     their \${ escaping so they are evaluated inside the subshell as intended.
#
# FIX-C3 (2026-06-02):
#   — exp2_feynman_pca_4060 step added (STEP 5b) immediately after exp2_feynman.
#     Reruns the Feynman benchmark using the PCA-directed 40/60 extrapolation
#     split (build_extrap_split, extrap_train_frac=0.6) identical to all DeFi
#     benchmarks.  Outputs land in comparison_results/feynman-tests/exp2_pca_4060/
#     alongside a split_protocol_disclosure.json so downstream consumers can
#     detect any future split-config mismatch immediately.
#     The legacy random 80/20 results (9/30) are preserved under exp2/ and
#     locked as fixc3_baseline.json before the corrected run can proceed.
#     ci_runner_disclosure.yml gates A/B/C are triggered automatically once
#     the corrected run completes.
#
# FIX-0.05 (2026-06-01):
#   — NOISE_LEVELS default updated from "0.0,0.5,1.0,5.0,10.0" to "0.0,0.05,0.1,0.5,1.0"
#     at both the global export (line ~210) and the suppB inline env override.
#     The audit script expects noise_vals=[0.0,0.05,0.1,0.5,1.0]; the old default
#     omitted 0.05 (5%), causing noise_vals=[] / MISSING ehd_noise_robust_5pct.
#     New schedule matches paper audit expectations and CI dispatch input values.
#
# FIX-SCHEMA-C-NOISE (2026-06-01):
#   — _compute_ehd_noise_robust Schema C: fixed noise level extraction order.
#     suppB files are one-file-per-equation-per-noise-level; "noise_levels" in
#     each file is the FULL schedule (e.g. [0.0,0.05,0.1,0.5,1.0]) stored as
#     config metadata — NOT the noise level that file was actually run at.
#     The old code took max(noise_levels) = 1.0 for every file, so all rows
#     appeared to be at max_noise while the actual per-file noise level was lost.
#     New priority order:
#       1. Scalar "noise_level"/"sigma"/"noise" field in the JSON body
#       2. Noise level encoded in the filename
#       3. noise_levels list ONLY when it has exactly one element (unambiguous)
#          OR cross_noise_summary dict keys (true per-noise aggregates)
#     This restores the correct per-file noise level so max-noise rows are only
#     counted for files genuinely run at noise=1.0, resolving MISSING ehd_noise_robust_100pct.
#
# FIX-SCHEMA-C (2026-05-31):
#   — _compute_ehd_noise_robust: added Schema C handler for suppB files that have
#     NO per_noise dict. Actual suppB output is one-file-per-equation-per-noise-level
#     with r2 at the top level and noise level in noise_levels:[x] list.
#     flattened=0 confirmed per_noise was absent from every file; the per_noise loop
#     skipped all via "if not isinstance(per_noise, dict): continue".
#     Fix: after the per_noise loop, scan files without per_noise, extract file-level
#     r2 and noise level (noise_levels list / cross_noise_summary / scalar / filename),
#     and emit one synthetic row per file for the max-noise robustness check.
#
# FIX-FORCE-NOISE-LEVEL (2026-05-31):
#   — _compute_ehd_noise_robust: noise_level is now FORCE-ASSIGNED from the per_noise
#     dict key (not setdefault). setdefault was silently losing to inner dict fields
#     that carried a stale noise_level value from a different noise bucket, causing
#     all rows to appear at the wrong noise level and failing the max_noise filter.
#   — _file_r2 extraction switched from "or" chaining to explicit None check so
#     r2=0.0 (a valid value) is not treated as absent.
#   — _emit() helper consolidates row construction in one place for all code paths.
#   — sample diagnostic upgraded: explicit None check (not "or -1"), plus
#     flattened row count and all noise values seen in rows for CI debugging.
#
# FIX-NOISE-LEVELS-KEY (2026-05-31):
#   — _compute_ehd_noise_robust: noise_vals now seeded from file-level "noise_levels"
#     list and "per_noise" dict keys before falling back to row-level field scan.
#     suppB files store the noise schedule as top-level "noise_levels":[0.0,0.5,...]
#     and as keys of "per_noise" — no per-row "noise_level" scalar exists, so the
#     original row-scan found nothing and exited with "no noise_level field found".
#   — _has_r2 widened to include "success","r2_mean","r2_median","mean_r2","median_r2"
#     which appear in actual suppB noise-sweep JSON output files.
#
# FIX-EHD-SCHEMA (2026-05-31):
#   — _compute_ehd_noise_robust: added equation-name-keyed schema support for suppB.
#     suppB JSON files use per_noise[noise_level][equation_name] = {r2: ...} (not
#     the per_noise[noise_level] = {r2: ...} flat schema assumed previously).
#     _iter_rows yielded the equation-name dict as a leaf (no recognised container key),
#     making _r2_from_row return None for every row → n_total=0 → MISSING.
#     Two-part fix:
#     (1) _nested walk now checks each equation-keyed value directly as a metric row
#         before falling through to per_equation/method_summary sub-keys.
#     (2) Last-resort fallback now only appends a row when _r2_from_row succeeds on
#         it directly, and recurses into its children if not — prevents appending
#         equation-name dicts that have zero R² fields.
#
# FIXES (observ-02 audit 2026-05-27):
#   — FIX-suppA-BUG-A : purge_dir moved BEFORE run_hybrid_system_benchmark.py in suppA.
#                        Previously purge_dir ran after the script wrote its outputs,
#                        deleting all results (critical/breaking).
#   — FIX-NOISE_LEVELS : export NOISE_LEVELS globally at config level.
#                        Without this, suppB silently fell back to its internal default
#                        instead of the CI/dispatch value → silent reproducibility drift.
#   — FIX-PYSR_POPULATION : removed export PYSR_POPULATION=100 (singular).
#                        Only PYSR_POPULATIONS (plural, value 30) is read by scripts.
#                        The singular variable was never used but scripts calling
#                        os.getenv("PYSR_POPULATION") would silently get 100 (wrong).
#   — FIX-exp1b-D      : relaxed exp1b count=0 from hard exit 1 to conditional warning.
#                        A zero count is valid when the step is intentionally skipped;
#                        hard failure broke --from / shard-filter workflows.
#                        Override with SKIP_ALLOWED=true to suppress the warning.

# ── STEP 3: extrap ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Patch 4 — FULL REWRITE STEP 3
#
# Activates the OOD extrapolation path in run_comparative_suite_benchmark_v2.py
# via three argparse flags introduced in Patch 4 (line 3585):
#
#   --extrap               Enable STEP 3 OOD comparative mode (Tab 9 OOD columns).
#                          Without this flag the script runs the standard in-dist
#                          benchmark and extrap_r2 is never computed.
#
#   --extrap-multiplier X  OOD test range upper bound as a multiple of training max.
#                          Default / paper value: 2.0  →  test on [x_max … 2·x_max].
#                          Override via env: EXTRAP_MULTIPLIER (e.g. CI fast-mode 1.5).
#
#   --extrap-train-frac F  Fraction of each variable range used for training.
#                          Default / paper value: 0.8  →  train on [x_min … x_min + 0.8·Δx].
#                          Top 20 % of the in-distribution range is held out; OOD
#                          test begins at x_max (= x_min + Δx).
#                          Override via env: EXTRAP_TRAIN_FRAC.
#
# Output: comparison_results/extrapolation/all_domains_extrap_v4_<TS>.json
#         Schema includes extrap_r2 / extrap_rmse / extrap_error_pct per method
#         per equation — these are the Tab 9 OOD columns read by generate_tables.py.
#
# Env-override knobs (CI / ablation use):
#   EXTRAP_MULTIPLIER   (default: 2.0)   — paper "medium" OOD regime

# ── STEP 5: exp2_feynman ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# BUG 1 + BUG 4 FIX (ci parity): previous monolithic call ran ALL 11 Feynman
#   domains on a single worker (no --domain filter) and omitted --output-dir,
#   so results landed in the default comparison_results/ path rather than
#   comparison_results/feynman-tests/exp2/ (RESULT_SUBDIR).
# All 6 methods active; METHOD_TIMEOUT (900s) gives methods 5+6 (SymbolicEngine, HybridV50_2)
#   adequate PySR budget.
# --noiseless --threshold 0.9999: exp2_feynman uses the noiseless Feynman
#   protocol, matching FEYNMAN_NOISELESS_THRESHOLD from repro.yaml.
# --parsimony 0.01 --populations: matches CI worker invocation exactly.
# Domains: 11 Feynman sub-domains derived from experiment_protocol_benchmark_v2.py
#   _build_domain_map() — same list as CI FEYNMAN_DOMAIN_IDS.
# FIX-DOMAINS: removed feynman_astronomy + feynman_fluid_dynamics (don't exist in
# BenchmarkProtocol._build_domain_map()); added feynman_magnetism + feynman_probability
# (present in protocol). Matches CI FEYNMAN_DOMAINS authoritative list exactly.
# NOTE: FEYNMAN_DOMAINS is defined once at the top of the script (line ~152) and
# must not be re-assigned here — doing so produces two sources of truth that can
# silently diverge.  The hoisted definition is used by all steps that reference it.

# ── STEP 5b: exp2_feynman_pca_4060 ───────────────────────────────────────────
# FIX-C3: Corrected Feynman benchmark rerun using the PCA-directed 40/60
# split — the same protocol used for all DeFi benchmarks (§10.2–10.4) and
# described in §6.4.  The original exp2_feynman used train_test_split
# (random 80/20), which is materially easier and was NOT disclosed in §10.7.
#
# FIX-C3-SCRIPT: This step invokes run_comparative_suite_benchmark_pca.py —
# the dedicated PCA-split variant of the benchmark runner.  Unlike
# run_comparative_suite_benchmark_v2.py (which requires --extrap flags to
# activate build_extrap_split at the CLI level), the PCA script hard-wires
# pca_directed_split(test_size=0.6) inside ImprovedNN.run() at the method
# level, making the split identical to the DeFi benchmark by construction.
#
# This step:
#   1. Locks the legacy 9/30 baseline in fixc3_baseline.json (once, idempotent).
#   2. Reruns every Feynman domain via run_comparative_suite_benchmark_pca.py
#      (PCA split is method-level, no --extrap flags needed).
#   3. Writes results to exp2_pca_4060/ (never overwrites the legacy exp2/).
#   4. Emits split_protocol_disclosure.json in exp2_pca_4060/ so Gates A/B/C
#      in ci_runner_disclosure.yml can confirm protocol parity with DeFi.
#
# Output directory: comparison_results/feynman-tests/exp2_pca_4060/
# Key result file:  exp2_pca_4060_summary.json  (corrected solve rate, replaces 9/30)
# Disclosure file:  exp2_pca_4060/split_protocol_disclosure.json

# Generates extrap_r2_far for every Feynman equation by re-running
# run_comparative_suite_benchmark_v2.py with --extrap on the same domain set
# as exp2_feynman.
#
# WHY THIS STEP EXISTS
# The main exp2_feynman run (STEP 5) trains each method on the full 200-sample
# dataset and records r2 / rmse (in-distribution).  run_analysis.py (ablation
# mode) additionally requires hypatia.extrap_r2_far / pysr_only.extrap_r2_far
# for every equation to run the Mann-Whitney test that is the paper's primary
# ablation claim (Table 14).  Without this step the field is never computed, the
# pairing fails, and the test exits with 0 pairs — this was the root cause of
# the "not a Mann-Whitney issue" diagnosis in the project log.
#
# WHAT --extrap DOES (run_comparative_suite_benchmark_v2.py, BUG 3 FIX)
#   1. Sorts each equation's samples by X[:,0] (first variable).
#   2. Trains every method on the first --extrap-train-frac (80%) of rows
#      — the "near" region.
#   3. After each method returns a formula string, re-evaluates that formula on
#      the remaining 20% of rows (the "far" region, beyond training max).
#   4. Records R² on the far region as extrap_r2_far in the result record and
#      in the flat benchmark_results.json (alongside the normal r2 field).
#
# OUTPUT SCHEMA (protocol_core_extrap_<TS>.json + benchmark_results.json)
#   Per record: { ..., "extrap_r2_far": { "method_name": float_or_null, ... } }
#   Per flat row: { ..., "extrap_r2_far": float_or_null }
#
# merge_extrap_into_benchmark.py (called by CI YAML exp2_feynman extrap step)
# reads these outputs alongside the noiseless benchmark_results.json and produces
# ablation_paired.json — the input schema run_analysis.py (ablation mode) needs.
#
# DATA CONDITIONS: --noiseless matches the main exp2_feynman run so r2 values
# are directly comparable.  --noiseless and --extrap are independent argparse
# flags (confirmed in BUG 3 FIX section of the script) and do not conflict.
#
# DOMAIN FILTER: DOMAIN_FILTER env var is set by CI to the shard's pending domain
# IDs (e.g. "feynman_biology feynman_chemistry").  ACTIVE_DOMAINS falls back to
# the full FEYNMAN_DOMAINS list when called locally without DOMAIN_FILTER.

  # INTERNAL extrap_r2_far MODULE MODE
  #
  # extrap_r2_far is now treated as an INTERNAL helper implemented directly
  # inside run_comparative_suite_benchmark_v2.py (fallback-safe import).
  #
  # Therefore:
  #   - no external extrap_r2_far.py verification is required
  #   - no sys.path patching is required
  #   - missing-module warnings are non-fatal
  #   - extrap metrics are always computed via internal fallback
  #
  # Expected runtime behavior:
  #
  #   ⚠️ extrap_r2_far.py not found — using internal fallback metrics
  #
  # This is VALID and SHOULD NOT fail the pipeline.

  # FIX-E6: benchmark_results_extrap.json overwrite-on-push guard.
  # Each shard pushes benchmark_results_extrap.json with no timestamp/shard suffix,
  # so every push silently overwrites the previous shard's file (E6).
  # Fix: after the domain loop, copy benchmark_results_extrap.json to a shard-suffixed
  # name alongside the original.  merge_extrap_into_benchmark.py reads the canonical
  # benchmark_results_extrap.json (unchanged); the suffixed copy is the pushable artefact
  # that will not collide with other shards on the same branch.

# FIX-EXP2-PROTOCOL: --benchmark both never routed to ExperimentProtocolAll —

#      help text and protocol-selection code directly. --benchmark only ever
#      selects BenchmarkProtocol's Feynman/SRBench sub-benchmark and is ignored
#      unless --protocol benchmark (the default) is active; it never switches
#      protocol classes. The prior "FIX: --protocol all30 does not exist ...
#      replaced with --benchmark both" fix (below, kept for history) was itself
#      based on a false assumption — it silently ran BenchmarkProtocol's
#      Feynman+SRBench domains (21 raw, unmapped domain keys: feynman_biology,
#      feynman_chemistry, ..., agriculture, energy, ..., synthetic) instead of
#      ExperimentProtocolAll's canonical 10-domain set, which is what
#      EXP2_DOMAINS below actually names. --protocol all_domains is the real,
#      already-implemented switch (see that script's own "NOTE ON ROOT CAUSE"
#      comment above its protocol-loading branch) — use it instead.
# ORIGINAL (now-incorrect) note, kept for history:
#   --protocol all30 does not exist in run_comparative_suite_benchmark_v2.py

#   Replaced with --benchmark both which runs both Feynman + SRBench protocols

# ── STEP 10: suppB — noise sweep ─────────────────────────────────────────────

#
# FIX-suppB-ALL-METHODS: run_dual_sweep_benchmarks.py (the orchestrator that
# wraps both run_noise_sweep_benchmark.py and run_sample_complexity_benchmark.py)
# defaults --methods to [3, 4] for BOTH sweeps. run_sample_complexity_benchmark.py
# confirms this is its own --methods default too (docstring: "top two methods").
# run_noise_sweep_benchmark.py's source was not directly inspected here, but
# ci_postprocess.yml's own comments group suppB and suppB_sc together as both
# producing only "EnhancedHybridSystemDeFi (core)" + "HybridSystemLLMNN
# all-domains (core)" — i.e. the same 2-method scope — so this is treated as
# the same default and patched the same way as suppB_sc's FIX-suppB_sc-ALL-
# METHODS fix. fig_runtime_comparison and fig_comparative_table in
# generate_figures.py read EXCLUSIVELY from noise_sweep_*.json /
# sample_complexity_*.json — there is no code path pulling method coverage
# from exp2, suppA, or hybrid_all_domains for these two figures, so the
# cross-experiment ALLEXP_FIGDIR regeneration pass in ci_postprocess.yml
# cannot fill the gap no matter how complete those other experiments are.
#
# COST/RISK + MITIGATION: this is why EXP_SHARD_TABLE["suppB"] was bumped
# from 1 to 5 shards (one per noise level — see that table's comment in
# ci_runner.yml for why 4 shards would silently mis-pin NOISE_LEVEL). Each
# shard now only needs to cover 1 noise level x 11 domains x 6 methods
# instead of 5 noise levels x 11 domains x 2 methods on a single shard, so
# total wall-clock per shard should stay comparable to (or lower than) the
# pre-fix single-shard 2-method run. Methods 5/6 remain PySR-backed with
# their own --pysr-timeout/--method-timeout per fit; if a shard still hits
# its job timeout, verify run_noise_sweep_benchmark.py actually has a
# --methods flag (the assumption above) before assuming the timeout is
# purely a workload-size problem.

  #
  #   _RESULTS_DIR = _OUT_BASE / 'comparison_results/feynman-tests/noise-sweep'
  #   (that file, line 106) — single level, no further nesting anywhere in
  #   that script or in run_comparative_suite_benchmark_v2.py (the subprocess
  #   it calls via --output-dir=_RESULTS_DIR; that script own _OUTPUT_DIR =
  #   Path(args.output_dir).resolve(), unmodified). So with OUT_BASE set to
  #   the plain results root (as it is below, and at the job-level env:
  #   OUT_BASE: hypatiax/data/results), the script real, single-level
  #   output directory is:
  #     \${RESULTS_DIR}/comparison_results/feynman-tests/noise-sweep/
  #   This is correct and requires no OUT_BASE change here.
  #
  #   The doubled path observed in one run (.../noise-sweep/noise-sweep/) did
  #   NOT come from this script. It came from ci_runner.yml Move-results-to-
  #   RESULTS_DIR step, which computes TARGET equal to RESULTS_DIR joined with
  #   RESULT_SUBDIR, and moves any matching result files it finds under the
  #   workspace into TARGET. When RESULT_SUBDIR for suppB was (mistakenly, at
  #   one point) set to the doubled value, that move step relocated this
  #   script correctly-written single-level output one level deeper —
  #   manufacturing the doubled structure AFTER the script had already run
  #   correctly.
  #
  #   Fix landed in ci_runner.yml (suppB RESULT_SUBDIR), ci_postprocess.yml
  #   (SUPPB_SUBDIR plus its MAPPING fallback), and ci_analysis.yml (MAPPING
  #   fallback) — all three now use the single-level path to match this
  #   script real, confirmed behavior. No change needed here in run_all.sh;
  #   OUT_BASE='\${RESULTS_DIR}' (no suffix) was already correct.

# generate_figures.py read EXCLUSIVELY from noise_sweep_*.json /
# sample_complexity_*.json (the suppB / suppB_sc outputs) — there is no
# code path that pulls method coverage from exp2, suppA, or
# hybrid_all_domains for these two figures, so ci_postprocess.yml's
# cross-experiment ALLEXP_FIGDIR regeneration pass cannot fill the gap no
# matter how complete those other experiments are. Passing --methods
# explicitly here is therefore the only way to get all 6 methods into
# those two figures.
#
# FIX-suppB_sc-SHARD-6: this step now runs as 6 CI shards (ci_runner.yml
# EXP_SHARD_TABLE["suppB_sc"] = 6), one per sample size n, mirroring suppB's
# one-noise-level-per-shard design (STEP 10 above). Each shard covers
# 1 sample size x 11 feynman domains x 6 methods instead of 6 sample sizes
# x 11 domains x 6 methods on a single shard — this is what makes running
# all 6 methods (instead of the 2-method default) tractable within a single
# job timeout; see COST/RISK below for the per-shard budget this assumes.
# SC_SAMPLE_COUNTS is pinned to the single n extracted from this shard's
# first task ID (sc_n{n}__{domain}) below, the same way STEP 10 pins
# NOISE_LEVEL from its shard's first task ID.
#
# FIX-suppB_sc-METHOD-ASSERT: after the run, this step now hard-fails if the
# resulting sample_complexity_*.json for this shard's n does not contain all
# 6 methods in method_summary. Without this check, a shard that times out or
# is invoked without --methods (e.g. a future manual re-run, or a stale cached
# checkpoint with RESUME=true) silently writes a partial 2-method JSON that
# passes ci_pipeline_analysis.yml's content-based completion check (which
# only verifies sample_sizes coverage, not method coverage — see that file's
# "suppB / suppB_sc: content-based check (FIX 6)" comment) and produces
# degraded fig_runtime_comparison / fig_comparative_table downstream with no
# CI signal. This assertion turns that into a loud, immediate job failure.
#
# COST/RISK: each of the 6 shards covers 11 domains x 6 methods at one fixed
# n. Methods 5 and 6 are PySR-backed (see run_sample_complexity_benchmark.py
# --skip-pysr) with their own --pysr-timeout (1100s) and --method-timeout
# (900s) per fit. Per-task cost is NOT uniform across n — larger n means
# slower fits — so the n=1000 shard is expected to be the long pole among
# the 6. Those per-method/per-PySR-fit timeouts bound worst-case time per
# (equation, method) — they do NOT bound the job's TOTAL wall-clock, which
# is gated only by the 330-minute job timeout and JOB_DEADLINE (19800s)
# above it. If the largest-n shard starts hitting the job timeout, the
# first things to try are: (a) sharding suppB_sc further by splitting the
# n=1000 block across two shards (EXP_SHARD_TABLE bump from 6 to 7, with a
# matching split in SUPPB_SC_IDS/ci_runner.yml's domain partition for that
# one n), or (b) dropping back to --methods 3 4 5 6 (skip the two cheapest/
# least informative methods instead of the two PySR ones) for the n=1000
# shard only, via a per-shard SC_METHODS override mirroring SC_SAMPLE_COUNTS.

#                  with Step 11 (tables) now also writing under ${RESULTS_DIR}/.
#
# FIX FIGURES-A  : generate_figures.py MUST be called with --experiment <id>
#                  (mirrors ci_postprocess.yml A1–A14).  Calling it without
#                  --experiment caused it to either do nothing or write to a
#                  tools-level path (hypatiax/tools/figures/results.pdf) that
#                  is never read by LaTeX — root cause of all suppB/instability
#                  figure files being absent from ${RESULTS_DIR}/figures/.
#
# FIX FIGURES-B  : suppB figures must be read from AND written to the CANONICAL
#                  suppB subdirectory (comparison_results/feynman-tests/
#                  noise-sweep/figures/) — mirrors ci_postprocess.yml
#                  A10 "CRITICAL" comment.  suppB_sc likewise uses its own subdir.
#                  Previous code pointed --results-dir at ${RESULTS_DIR} root,
#                  causing generate_figures.py to find no noise_sweep_*.json
#                  and write empty placeholder PDFs.
#
# FIX FIGURES-C  : Group C (5 hand-crafted main-paper figures) are NEVER produced
#                  by any runner or generate_figures.py call.  They must be copied
#                  from their source locations under ${REPO_ROOT}/Figures/ into
#                  ${RESULTS_DIR}/figures/ (the path LaTeX reads via
#                  \graphicspath{{figures/}{../figures/}}).
#                  Previously there was no copy step at all — all 5 were always
#                  missing from the final figures/ directory.
#

#
#   GROUP A — per-experiment figures (runner output → generate_figures.py)

#             exp2, exp3, exp3b, suppA
#             → written to ${RESULTS_DIR}/figures/
#
#   GROUP B — suppB / suppB_sc sweep figures (noise_sweep_*.json → plots)
#             → written to their canonical subdirs' figures/ then copied to
#               ${RESULTS_DIR}/figures/ so LaTeX can find them
#             Stems: fig1_r2_vs_noise … fig11_recovery_heatmap (PDFs, 11 stems)
#                    fig_runtime_comparison.png, fig_comparative_table.png (2 stems)
#
#   GROUP C — hand-crafted / cosmetic figures (no runner, no generator)
#             Must already exist under ${REPO_ROOT}/Figures/ subdirs.
#             This step copies them into ${RESULTS_DIR}/figures/.

  # ── Sync ${RESULTS_DIR}/figures/*.* into \${REPO_ROOT}/figures/ (LaTeX target) ─
  # FIX FIGURES-ROOT-SYNC: run_all.sh previously only ever wrote figures under
  # \${RESULTS_DIR}/figures/ (hypatiax/data/results/figures by default). The CI
  # pipeline (ci_paper_audit.yml \"Copy hypatiax/data/results/figures/*.* into
  # repo-root figures/\") additionally deploys a flat copy to \${REPO_ROOT}/figures/,
  # which is what \\includegraphics resolves via \\graphicspath{{figures/}{../figures/}}
  # when pdflatex is invoked from \${REPO_ROOT}. Without this step, a local
  # `run_all.sh` reproduction would leave \${REPO_ROOT}/figures/ empty/stale even
  # though \${RESULTS_DIR}/figures/ is fully populated, and a local pdflatex build
  # would silently diverge from what CI produces.
  #
  # Mirrors the CI step's semantics exactly:
  #   - non-recursive: only files directly inside \${RESULTS_DIR}/figures/ are
  #     copied (cp, not cp -r), so no nested figures/figures/ can be created
  #     even if a stray subdirectory (e.g. a leftover tables/) exists there.
  #   - destination basenames only: cp -f \"\${FILES[@]}\" \"\${REPO_ROOT}/figures/\"
  #     always lands files flat inside figures/, never inside a path that
  #     reproduces source subdirectory structure.
  #   - additive, not mirrored: cp -f (not rsync --delete), so hand-crafted or
  #     previously-deployed files at \${REPO_ROOT}/figures/ are never removed.

#
# WHY THIS STEP EXISTS
# The Feynman benchmark (§10.7) calls run_comparative_suite_benchmark_v2.py
# without --extrap, so the NN method's run() invokes:
#
#   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
#       X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42          ← random 80/20
#   )
#
# All DeFi benchmarks (§10.2–10.4) use the PCA-directed 40/60 extrapolation
# split (build_extrap_split, extrap_train_frac=0.6, extrap_multiplier=2.0).
# These are different, *easier* vs harder splits; claiming Feynman results are
# directly comparable to DeFi results is the substantive scientific issue
# flagged as FIX-C3 in the audit (NB-06).
#
# ACTION A (this step): write a machine-readable disclosure record into
#   ${RESULTS_DIR}/fixc3_split_disclosure.json
# that documents the mismatch and passes only when:
#   (1) the disclosure JSON exists (confirming this step ran), and
#   (2) the split protocol difference is correctly recorded in §10.7 result files.
#
# The downstream paper-audit (audit_paper) should reference
# fixc3_split_disclosure.json to assert the disclosure is present before
# publishing the 9/30 result.

# ── STEP 22b: audit_nb06_fixc3_rerun (FIX-C3 Action B) ──────────────────────
# NB-06 · Feynman Rerun with PCA 40/60 Split (FIX-C3 §10.7 corrected result)
#
# WHY THIS STEP EXISTS
# FIX-C3 Action B requires rerunning the Feynman benchmark (§10.7) with the
# same PCA-directed 40/60 extrapolation split used by all DeFi benchmarks
# (§10.2–10.4, §6.4), so the 9/30 result can be revised to a number that is
# scientifically comparable.
#
# HOW IT WORKS
# Invokes run_comparative_suite_benchmark_v2.py with:
#   --extrap                      activate build_extrap_split (PCA path)
#   --extrap-train-frac 0.6       40% held-out far region (matches §6.4 "40/60")
#   --extrap-multiplier 2.0       OOD multiplier (paper value, same as DeFi)
# per domain (same domain loop as exp2_feynman), writing to:
#   comparison_results/feynman-tests/exp2_fixc3/
#
# The solve-rate computed from these outputs is the corrected §10.7 figure that
# replaces "9/30" in a revised paper submission.
#
# OUTPUT FILES
#   ${RESULTS_DIR}/comparison_results/feynman-tests/exp2_fixc3/
#       protocol_core_fixc3_<domain>_<TS>.json      ← per-domain results
#   ${RESULTS_DIR}/fixc3_rerun_summary.json         ← solve-rate summary
#
# RELATIONSHIP TO audit_nb06_fixc3_disclosure (Action A)
#   Action A must run first (creates fixc3_split_disclosure.json).
#   Action B reads that disclosure to confirm the mismatch was logged before
#   writing the corrected result.  Both must PASS for FIX-C3 to be resolved.
